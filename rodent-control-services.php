              Since they and their parasites carry various diseases, rodents can
              pose significant health, economic, and safety risks. Every year,
              they pollute and damage property (both commercial and
              residential), food, and other commodities worth hundreds of
              millions of dollars. Rodents are particularly harmful in
              agricultural and food processing plants because their urine and
              droppings contaminate food and animal feed.
            </p>
            <h2>We use the following methods to keep rodents at bay:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li class="fas fa-check">
                The first step in controlling rodents is to make your house or
                business less appealing to them. These preventive measures can
                help keep rodents out of your home:
              </li>
            <p>
              <li class="fas fa-check"> Make sure there are no gaps between any of the doors.</li>
            </p>
            <p>  
              <li class="fas fa-check">
                Seal any cracks on the structureâ€™s exterior at least 14 inches
                in diameter and allow rodents to enter.
              </li>
            </p>
              <li class="fas fa-check">
                Trash cans and dumpsters should have coverings that fit snugly.
              </li>
            <p>
              <li class="fas fa-check">
                Keep all indoor and outdoor locations clean and clutter-free.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li class="fas fa-check">
                Grain, pet food, and other food products should be stored in
                airtight metal containers.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li class="fas fa-check">
                To prevent rodents from utilizing trees and shrubs to gain
                access to the building, trim them back. Keep an 18-inch space
                between these trees and plants and your structure.
              </li>
            </p>
              <li class="fas fa-check">
                Firewood should be kept at the smallest 20 feet away from the
                house and five inches off the ground.
              </li>
            </ul>
